## times

- early on you say that "store-time" is preferred: "...Use a per-collection checkpoint based on WASAPI store-time (or crawl-time if store-time is missing) because it most closely tracks “available for download”. ..."
    - but in the storage-section you say: `yyyy/mm/dd is derived from crawl-start (preferred) or store-time.`
    - why the difference?
